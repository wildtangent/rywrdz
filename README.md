# Rewards System

The rewards system helps users to find out if they are entitled to any upgrades

Presently the rewards system is just a JSON endpoint and classes


You can start the app with the standard Rails server scripts

```shell
  bundle install
  bundle exec rails server
```
You can request the JSON output at http://localhost:3000/rewards?account_number=account_number&tariff=tariff

Because there is not Eligibility Service implemented, the default behaviour is to always return no eligiblity. This is stubbed in the tests to provide the various use cases.

## TEST COVERAGE
The test suite covers both the models, controller and features and can be run using Guard, or via Rspec, Cucumber respectively

```shell
guard
```

or

```shell
bundle exec rake spec
bundle exec cucumber
```

It is also possible to run some code linters (Rubocop is run automatically with Guard)

```shell
reek
rubocop
```
